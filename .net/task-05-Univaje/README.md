## Purpose of this task

The purposes of this task are:

- to learn basics of ASP.NET MVC style web application
- to learn routing to controllers and actions
- to learn to handle GET and POST requests in MVC app

## Material for the task

> **Following material will help with the task.**

It is recommended that you will check the material before start coding.

1. [Overview of ASP.NET Core MVC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
2. [Get started with ASP.NET Core MVC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

## The Task

Create a Phone database web application with ASP.NET MVC. The app has basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on data. The app uses SQLite database as a persistent storage for phone data. The model classes, DbContext and SQLite configuration is given. The task is to create the user interface and code to handle user's actions. The solution must have `PhonesController` controller class in default location for MVC apps. That class contains the code for phone data CRUD operations.

### Evaluation points

1. Index view (/) that renders text: `Welcome to the Modern Phone database in MVC` in H1 tag and top 4 latest added or modified phones with all info (all fields' data) in a HTML table element. Each property is in its own table cell. The table must contain a header row with the property names on columns. The `Id` property is in the first column.
2. A list page (/phones) that lists all the phones from the database in alphabetical order by Make and then by Model fields. Use `ul` element with css class `phones` to list the phones. Each `li` element in the `ul` element contains the phone's make and model as the element's text content and links (`a` element) to edit and delete pages for the current phone. The list page has also a link button (`a` element styled as a button using bootstrap styles) to add page (/phones/add).
3. Add view (/phones/add) that contains fields for all Phone class' properties except the fields that are populated by the app (the fields are marked with code comments on the class declaration). Use `Phone` class as the model type. Model the fields so that POSTing the form will add a new phone information to the database. The view must not contain any other fields for data input. Use `button` element as the submit button. When the POST is successful the app redirects to /phones view to list all the phones including the newly added phone.
4. Edit view (/phones/edit/[id]) that allows editing of the phone's data. Value for the [id] part of the url selects the phone to be edited by it's Id property. Edit view renders input fields for all of the `Phone` class' properties and marks input fields for properties `Id`, `Created` and `Modified` to readonly so user gets the indication that these fields should not be modified by the user. The view must not contain any other fields for data input. Use `Phone` class as the model type. Use `button` element as the submit button. POSTing the form makes the changes to the selected phone object and persists them to the database. When the POST is successful the app redirects to /phones view to list all the phones including the changed phone.
5. Delete view (/phones/delete/[id]) that shows all of the selected phone's details and a button (submit type) where user can click to confirm delete. POSTing the confirmation form deletes the selected phone from the database. When the POST is successful the app redirects to /phones view to list all the remaining phones.

> **Note!** Read the task description and the evaluation points to get the task's specification (what is required to make the app complete).

## Task evaluation

Evaluation points for the task are described above. An evaluation point either works or does not work there is no "it kind of works" step in between. Be sure to test your work. All working evaluation points are added to the task total and will count toward the course total. The task is worth five (5) points. Each evaluation point is checked individually and each will provide one (1) point so there are five checkpoints. Checkpoints are designed so that they may require additional code, that is not checked or tested, to function correctly.

## DevOps

There is a DevOps pipeline added to this task. The pipeline will build the solution and run automated tests on it. The pipeline triggers when a commit is pushed to GitHub on the main branch. So remember to `git commit` and `git push` when you are ready with the task. The automation uses GitHub Actions and some task runners. The automation is in the folder named .github.
